# Detecting-phishing-websites
OBJECTIVE :
A phishing internet site is the most common social engineering approach that mimics trustful URLs and web pages. This project aims to predict phishing websites whether are good URLs or bad URLs. Both phishing and benign URLs of websites are collected to form a dataset and from them required URLs and these projects aimed functions are extracted. We have used so many different libraries and algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree and many more. We gather data to create a dataset of malicious links and curate it for the ML model. The performance level of every model is measured and compared.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
These are the following Hardware and software requirements for the system.
3.3.1 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:

• Intel core i5 /i7 10th Gen
• 8GB RAM
3.3.2 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:

• Windows Operating System
• Jupyter Notebook
• Google Collab
• Python 3.4 and above.
• Web Framework: Flask

IMPLEMENTATION:

Data Collection:
      Gather a dataset of URLs labeled as phishing or legitimate websites. You can find public datasets or create your own by manually labeling URLs.
Data Preprocessing:
     Clean and preprocess the URLs to remove noise, special characters, and irrelevant information.
     
Feature Engineering:
      Analyze the dataset to understand which features are most relevant for phishing detection.
      
Data Splitting:
      Split the dataset into training and testing sets. This is important to evaluate the model's performance on unseen    data.
      
Model Selection:
Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for the detection task. Common choices include Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks.

Model Training: Train the selected model on the training dataset.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using the testing dataset.

Model Deployment: Once you have a well-performing model, deploy it in a production environment.

Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the model's performance in the real world
